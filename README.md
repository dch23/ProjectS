# ProjectS
This is a small project where I experimented with a procedurally animated tail and unique controls.

## How to play
- Download the executable [here](ProjectS/ProjectSExecutable.zip)
- Press z to be gravitated towards the mouse.
- Click the left mouse button to shoot a projectile towards your mouse.
- Defeat all enemies to move to the next stage.
